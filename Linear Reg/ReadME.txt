Linear Regression Project
=========================

This project shows how to perform linear regression using gradient descent in Python.

Files:
------
1. linear_reg.py  - Main Python script that trains a linear model.
2. sample.csv     - Data file with x and y values.

What it does:
-------------
- Reads data from sample.csv
- Uses gradient descent to fit a line (y = mx + b)
- Shows how the line improves step by step using a graph

How to run:
-----------
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install numpy matplotlib
3. Run the script:
   python linear_reg.py

You will see a plot showing the progress of the line fitting the data.
